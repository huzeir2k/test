          <h2>About Me:</h2>
           <article id="thing1">
           
           <p>As I said in the home page, I'm a college student enrolled in the Mobile Applications Development in St. Clair College.</p>
           <p>However, it's a little more deeper than that. I am currently 19 years old, and I'm from Canada. I was born on September 11th, 2000 in Vinkovci, Croatia. I lived in Bosnia and Herzegovina for 6 months before emigrating to Canada to start a new life. I am currently trying to set everything up for myself so i can begin living this said "new life", which I think will be very... interesting. :) </p>

            <article id="thing2">
               <ul>
                  Aside from that, here are some other things that I am interested in:
                   <li>History</li>
                   <li>Travelling</li>
                   <li>Anthropology, Sociology and Psychology</li>
                   <li>Learning languages</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
           <article id="thing3">
               <p>As of now, I rarely pay attention to anything related to anything else but my interests and any of my clientele that needs something done by me or some of my frequent collaborators from college. As a person in the working field, I am an open, straight-forward, hard-working person that does not like quitting, is usually stubborn and persistent, and I also offer alot of insights on different subjects, and I've worked with numerous teams on different projects.</p>
                
                <ul>

                <ul>

                </ul>
